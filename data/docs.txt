Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to machines or software systems that can perform tasks which typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and decision-making. AI systems can process information, recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve complex problems. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. AI applications include natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and autonomous systems. The goal of AI is to create intelligent machines that can think, learn, and adapt like humans.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation, commonly known as RAG, is a powerful technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. RAG works by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base and then providing those documents as context to a language model before generating a response. This two-step process helps reduce hallucinations and improves factual accuracy in AI responses. RAG systems typically use vector databases to store and search through documents efficiently. When a question is asked, RAG retrieves the most relevant information and uses it to generate accurate, grounded answers. RAG is widely used in question-answering systems, chatbots, and AI assistants that need to provide factual information. The main advantage of RAG is that it allows language models to access up-to-date information without retraining, making it cost-effective and scalable.

FAISS, which stands for Facebook AI Similarity Search, is a vector database library developed by Facebook AI Research. FAISS is specifically designed for efficient similarity search over high-dimensional vector embeddings. It uses advanced indexing techniques to quickly find similar vectors in large datasets. FAISS supports both CPU and GPU implementations, making it suitable for various hardware configurations. It is widely used in semantic search applications, recommendation systems, and machine learning pipelines that require fast similarity matching. FAISS can handle millions or even billions of vectors efficiently, making it a popular choice for large-scale applications. The library provides various indexing methods optimized for different use cases, including exact search and approximate nearest neighbor search.

LangChain is a comprehensive framework designed to build applications powered by large language models. LangChain provides a wide range of components for building AI applications, including prompt management, document retrieval, memory systems, and agent-based reasoning. The framework simplifies the process of connecting language models to various data sources and tools. LangChain supports multiple LLM providers and offers abstractions for common patterns like chains, agents, and memory. It includes built-in support for vector stores, document loaders, and text splitters, making it easy to implement RAG systems. LangChain also provides tools for building conversational AI applications with memory and context management. The framework is modular and extensible, allowing developers to customize and combine components to build complex AI applications.

Agentic AI systems are advanced artificial intelligence systems capable of autonomous decision-making. Unlike traditional AI systems that follow fixed pipelines, agentic AI systems can decide which tools to use, when to retrieve information, and how to solve a task step by step. These systems can break down complex problems into smaller sub-tasks and determine the best approach to solve them. Agentic AI systems often use reasoning frameworks to plan and execute actions autonomously. They can interact with external tools, databases, and APIs to gather information and perform tasks. The key characteristic of agentic AI is its ability to make independent decisions about how to approach and solve problems, making it more flexible and capable than rule-based systems. Agentic AI is particularly useful for complex tasks that require multiple steps, tool usage, and adaptive problem-solving strategies.
